# Energy Behavior of Solar Panels Prosumers in Estonia
### Unit of the analysis
In this analysis we model and predict the amount of electricity produced and consumed by Estonian energy customers who have installed solar panels.<br> 
This kind of customer are called **prosumers**. So a **prosumer** is either a company or a household that both consumes and produces energy.<br> 
The term is a portmanteau of the words producer and consumer. Here a prosumer is an entity that produces energy specifically by solar panels.

### Why is this important?
The number of prosumers in Estonia (and many other countries) has recently increased causing problems of **energy imbalance**. <br>
This could lead to higher operational costs, potential grid instability, and inefficient use of energy resources. And simply energy can be wasted in the area where in a given time period many prosumers produced more energy than expected.<br> 
Current predictions are very inefficient. Improving them would significantly:
- **reduce the imbalance costs**,
- **improve the reliability of the grid** and
- **make the integration of prosumers into the energy system more efficient and sustainable**.<br>

Accurate predictions of energy production and use is needed if we want to promote renewable energy and **incentivize more customers to become prosumers** showing them that their energy will be managed well.

### Data
Data is based on data from Kaggle competition: [Enefit - Predict Energy Behavior of Prosumers](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/predict-energy-behavior-of-prosumers).<br>
To decrease the size of the dataset we limit the data to only **one district in Estonia**.
